==========

Here are the code samples for my YouTube screencast series 'Intro to the Google Cloud for Java Developers' - here's the playlist URL - http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6971A0258365F21E

Tip: Be sure to set up your API credentials in the Google Cloud web console (as shown in the screencast) and to replace the "replace_me" values in the sample code with actual values from your project.

My blog at http://lynnlangit.com/category/google/ -- includes blogs, embedded slideshare decks and linked YouTube screencasts for each part of the series. Also, I have a list of links for this series on Tumblr at http://lynnlangit.tumblr.com/GoogleCloudDeveloperLinks.
	

Happy Programming!
